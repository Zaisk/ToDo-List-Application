**UPDATES**
- NEW GUI THEME

**READ ME!!!!**
# ToDo-List-Application 0.12
A simple ToDo List App

- JFC API, specifically Java Swing toolkit to create a basic gui. (JFrame, JPanel, JLabel, JTextField, JButton, JTextArea)
- Utilizes SQLite JDBC 3.42.0.0 to create database and deploy the tasks table to store data. 
- Utilizes GUI components to trigger actions by taking in lambda function as arguments and updates in SQLite database.  
- Basic try and catch block for error handling.
- Object-oriented java to create readable code.

HOW TO PROPERLY WORK APP:
1. Use IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Add SQLite JDBC jar to libraries (FOR INTELLIJ: Project-Structure > Libraries > add jar file).
3. You can run from IDE

IF YOU WANT TO BUILD JAR FOR APP
1. Goto project-structure > artificats > add Jar > from modules and dependencies > select 'ToDoList.java' > click ok
2. Goto build > build artificats
3. Open file path with artificats and open jar
4. DONE

**PLEASE NOTE**
This is a very basic ToDo List App, there is still alot to work on. :)
